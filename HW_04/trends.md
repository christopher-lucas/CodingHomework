Observations from the data:

Charters outperform districts. This is not surprising because charters tend to be schools of choice, 
meaning that they can select which students enroll. District don't have this option.

Math and reading scores are relatively stable across grades.

It's interesting that this district has only high schools. Federal law requires standardized testing beginning in third grade.

Per-student spending is negatively correlated with scores on standardized tests. 

Smaller schools tend to have higher scores.

Having the count (or percentage) of economically disadvantaged studets, english language learners, 
and student served by special education would allow for a much more detailed analysis. 

Not trying top be a jerk; education data is what I do for a living.
